# ExpressBeans
ExpressBeans is the IoC Container (Inversion of Control Container) that you didn't know you needed.
If you love Node.js and the Spring Boot way of code organization this lightweight framework is for you.
ExpressBeans is an almost zero dependency framework (it wraps Express.js) to offer an easy-to-use way of building your next Express project.

## Get started
Try ExpressBeans with the official generator:
```console
npm create express-beans-server
```

## Documentation
API docs and types available in [documentation](https://spaghiajoeojo.github.io/express-beans/).

## Usage
All you need is create an ExpressBeans application and provide your `RouterBean` classes:
```ts
ExpressBeans.createApp({
  routerBeans: [
    ExampleRouter,
  ],
});

/* ======== OR ======== */

const application = new ExpressBeans({
  routerBeans: [
    ExampleRouter,
  ],
});
```

If you need also direct access to `express` application:
```ts
const application = new ExpressBeans({
  routerBeans: [
    ExampleRouter,
  ],
});
const expressApp = application.getApp();
```

## Typescript 5
New decorators are here and ExpressBeans implements some simple decorators to achieve dependency injection and endpoint registration.

### Example

```ts
import { Request, Response } from 'express';
import { InjectBean, Route, RouterBean } from 'express-beans';
import { ExampleService } from '../services/ExampleService';

@RouterBean('/example')
export class ExampleRouter {

  @InjectBean(ExampleService)
  private exampleService: ExampleService;

  @Route('GET', '/hello')
  getHello(_req: Request, res: Response) {
    res.end(this.exampleService.example());
  }
}
```
This will create a new router that expose an endpoint `GET /example/hello` and
`exampleService` will be the instance of the class declared as it follow:
```ts
import { Bean } from 'express-beans';

@Bean
export class ExampleService {

  private msg: string;

  constructor() {
    this.msg = 'hello world!';
  }

  example() {
    return this.msg;
  }
}
```
## Installation

```console
npm install express-beans
```
 
## Beans Lifecycle

The lifecycle of the beans is the following:

- `start`: The application starts, and tasks registered for this phase are executed.
- `register`: Beans and router beans are registered.
- `routing`: Routes are registered.
- `init`: The application is initialized, and tasks registered for this phase are executed.
- `run`: The application is running, and tasks registered for this phase are executed.
- `exit`: The application is shutting down, and tasks registered for this phase are executed.

## Hooks

### Setup
You can use the `@Setup` hook to add a function that will be executed right after the application is initialized.

```ts
@Setup
mySetupFunction() {
  // do something
}
```
Every request received will be served only after the application is initialized and `@Setup` functions are executed.
process.emit('beforeExit', Number(code)
### Shutdown
You can use the `@Shutdown` hook to add a function that will be executed right before the application is shutdown.

### Order
You can use the `@Order` hook to set the execution order of a hook. The default order is 0, negative orders are executed before positive ones in the same phase.

```ts
@Shutdown
myShutdownFunction() {
  // do something
}
```

## Springboot like annotations
If you want to use Springboot like annotations you can use the following aliases:

- `@PostConstruct` -> `@Setup`
- `@PreDestroy` -> `@Shutdown`
- `@Component` -> `@Bean`
- `@Service` -> `@Bean`
- `@Controller` -> `@RouterBean`
- `@Mapping` -> `@Route`
- `@Autowired` -> `@InjectBean`
